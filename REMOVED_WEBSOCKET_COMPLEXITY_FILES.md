# Removed WebSocket Complexity Files

The following files were deleted as part of the migration to the new simple WebSocket architecture:

- src/lib/services/websocketService.production.ts
- src/lib/services/websocketService.optimized.ts
- src/lib/services/websocket/optimizedWebSocketService.ts
- src/lib/services/websocket/connectionManager.ts
- src/lib/services/websocket/memoryManager.ts
- src/lib/services/websocket/performanceMonitor.ts
- src/lib/services/websocket/types.ts
- src/lib/services/websocket/recheckDiagnostic.ts

All code should now use `websocketService.simple.ts` and the new React hooks/components.
