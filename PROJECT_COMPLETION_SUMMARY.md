## Production Deployment Options

### Option 1: New Production Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Complete production setup with default users
psql "postgres://user:pass@host:5432/domainflow_production" < backend/database/production_schema_v3.sql
```

### Option 2: Development Environment
```bash
# Local development setup
psql "postgres://domainflow:password@localhost:5432/domainflow?sslmode=disable" < backend/database/schema.sql
```

## Default Admin Access

| User | Email | Password | Role |
|------|-------|----------|------|
| Admin | `admin@domainflow.local` | `TempPassword123!` | Super Admin |
| DB Admin | `dbadmin@domainflow.local` | `dbpassword123!` | Super Admin |
| Test User | `user@domainflow.com` | `user123!` | Standard User |

**⚠️ Change all passwords after deployment!**
