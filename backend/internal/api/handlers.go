// Legacy validation handlers and their helpers (DNSValidateHandler, DNSValidateStreamHandler,
// HTTPValidateHandler, HTTPValidateStreamHandler, createHTTPClientForPersona,
// convertDNSPersonaConfig, isProxyRelatedError) have been removed as they are
// superseded by the campaign-based workflows.

// DTOs for legacy validation handlers (DNSValidationRequest, DNSValidationResponse,
// HTTPValidationRequest, HTTPValidationResponse) have also been removed.

// Note: Ensure all routes pointing to these removed handlers in router.go are also removed.
// (This was done in the previous step).

// Other handlers that were previously in this file (Persona, Proxy, Server Settings, Campaign DNS Settings, KeywordSet)
// have been moved to their respective dedicated files:
// - persona_handlers.go
// - proxy_handlers.go
// - server_settings_handlers.go
// - campaign_handlers.go (for legacy campaign DNS settings)
// - keyword_set_handlers.go

// PingHandler remains in ping_handler.go
// Utility functions (respondWithError, respondWithJSON, getProxyLogStr) are in api_utils.go

// This file might be empty now or contain only truly general handlers not fitting elsewhere.
// If empty, it can be deleted if no other api package files reference non-existent symbols from it.
