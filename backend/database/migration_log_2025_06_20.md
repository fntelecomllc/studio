   - Converted all campaign counter fields from INTEGER to BIGINT
   - Added constraints to ensure non-negative values
   - Created performance indexes for large counter values
   - Fixed domain generation parameters to support int64 values

2. **002_missing_required_columns** (Applied: 2025-06-20 13:09:46 UTC)
   - Added missing columns to domain_generation_campaign_params
   - Added source_type and source_campaign_id to http_keyword_params
   - Added tracking columns to campaigns table
   - Added user management fields (must_change_password, password_changed_at)

3. **003_enum_constraints_alignment** (Applied: 2025-06-20 13:09:55 UTC)
   - Fixed campaign status enum (removed 'archived')
   - Fixed campaign type enum (removed 'keyword_validate')

5. **cv007_campaign_bigint_fix** (Applied: 2025-06-20 13:10:23 UTC)
   - Verified campaign counter columns are already BIGINT (no changes needed)

### Important Notes:
- The view `v_campaign_numeric_safety` was dropped to allow migrations to proceed
- All migrations completed successfully with proper transaction handling
- Schema migrations table created to track applied migrations

### Database State:
- All int64 fields properly mapped to BIGINT
- Enum constraints aligned with Go backend
- Column naming conventions standardized
- Missing required columns added
- Database ready for MEDIUM priority fixes

### Next Steps:
- Clean up obsolete files as documented
- Proceed with MEDIUM priority frontend fixes
