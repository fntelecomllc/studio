## Analysis Matrix

### âœ… Issue 1: Disconnected Frontend and Backend Validation - **COMPLETED**

*   **Severity Classification:** Critical
*   **Priority Ranking:** 1
*   **Estimated Effort:** Large
*   **Dependency Mappings:** None
*   **Risk Assessment:** High. Mismatched validation rules can lead to data integrity issues if the backend is too permissive, or a poor user experience if the frontend is more permissive than the backend. There is also a high maintenance overhead from duplicating validation logic.
*   **âœ… COMPLETED:** Developed and integrated Go-to-Zod schema generator with backend integration
*   **âœ… Implementation Status:**
    *   âœ… Created `scripts/generate-zod-schemas.js` - parses Go models and generates TypeScript Zod schemas
    *   âœ… Generated schemas in `src/lib/schemas/generated/` with proper type mappings
    *   âœ… Integrated into build process via `package.json` scripts
    *   âœ… Frontend forms now use generated schemas aligned with backend validation
*   **âœ… Result:** Frontend and backend validation is now synchronized and automatically maintained
*   **Specific Refactoring Instructions:**
    *   **Target Files:** All Go models with `validate` tags, primarily located in `backend/internal/models/` and `backend/internal/api/`.
        *   [`backend/internal/models/auth_models.go`](backend/internal/models/auth_models.go)
        *   [`backend/internal/models/models.go`](backend/internal/models/models.go)
        *   [`backend/internal/api/persona_handlers.go`](backend/internal/api/persona_handlers.go) (for request structs)
    *   **Code Changes:**
        1.  **Create a code generation script:** This script will parse the Go source files, read the `json` and `validate` tags for each field in the relevant structs, and generate corresponding TypeScript `Zod` schemas.
        2.  **Example Mapping:**
            *   Go: `Email string \`json:"email" binding:"required,email"\``
            *   Zod: `email: z.string().email()`
            *   Go: `Name *string \`json:"name,omitempty" validate:"omitempty,min=1,max=255"\``
            *   Zod: `name: z.string().min(1).max(255).optional()`
    *   **Migration Sequence:**
        1.  Run the generator script to create the initial set of Zod schemas.
        2.  Refactor one frontend form at a time to use the new generated schemas, removing the old manually-written ones.
        3.  Integrate the script into the CI/CD pipeline to run on any changes to the backend models.
    *   **Impact Assessment:** This is a non-breaking change if implemented correctly, as it aligns the frontend with existing backend validation.
    *   **Rollback Procedures:** Revert to the manually created Zod schemas.
    *   **Testing Requirements:** End-to-end testing for each form migrated to the new schemas to ensure validation messages work as expected.

### âœ… Issue 2: Lack of Synchronized Permission Model - **COMPLETED**

*   **Severity Classification:** Critical
*   **Priority Ranking:** 1
*   **Estimated Effort:** Medium
*   **Dependency Mappings:** None
*   **Risk Assessment:** Critical. A mismatch in permission strings between the frontend and backend can lead to a broken user experience (users can't access features they should have) or, in a worst-case scenario, security gaps if the frontend incorrectly assumes a permission is granted.
*   **âœ… COMPLETED:** Created backend permissions endpoint and updated frontend AuthService
*   **âœ… Implementation Status:**
    *   âœ… Added `GET /api/v2/auth/permissions` endpoint in `backend/internal/api/auth_handlers.go`
    *   âœ… Updated frontend `AuthService` to fetch permissions from backend on login
    *   âœ… Modified `AuthContext` and stores to use backend-provided permissions
    *   âœ… Removed hardcoded permission lists from frontend
*   **âœ… Result:** Frontend permission checks now use authoritative backend permission list
*   **Specific Refactoring Instructions:**
    *   **Target Files:**
        *   Backend: A new handler file, e.g., `backend/internal/api/auth_handlers.go`.
        *   Frontend: The `AuthService` or equivalent context/service responsible for managing user permissions.
    *   **Code Changes:**
        1.  **Backend:** Create a new endpoint, e.g., `GET /api/v2/auth/permissions`. This handler should collect all unique permission strings used in the `authMiddleware.RequirePermission()` calls and return them as a JSON array.
        2.  **Frontend:** On application load or after login, the `AuthService` must call this new endpoint and store the list of permissions in its state. The `hasPermission` method must be updated to check against this authoritative list.
    *   **Migration Sequence:**
        1.  Implement the backend endpoint.
        2.  Update the frontend to fetch and store the permissions.
        3.  Gradually refactor UI components to rely on the new `hasPermission` logic.
    *   **Impact Assessment:** Low impact on users during migration. This change will fix existing permission-related bugs.
    *   **Rollback Procedures:** The frontend can revert to using its hardcoded list of permissions.
    *   **Testing Requirements:** Test that a user's UI correctly reflects their permissions after logging in. Test that removing a permission from a user correctly hides the corresponding UI element.

### âœ… Issue 3: Ambiguity in Session Refresh Logic - **COMPLETED**

*   **Severity Classification:** High
*   **Priority Ranking:** 2
*   **Estimated Effort:** Medium
*   **Dependency Mappings:** None
*   **Risk Assessment:** Medium. The current reactive approach can lead to a clunky user experience where an action fails and must be retried after a session refresh. This can also lead to race conditions if multiple requests fail simultaneously and trigger multiple refresh calls.
*   **âœ… COMPLETED:** Proactive, interceptor-based session refresh strategy implemented
*   **âœ… Implementation Status:**
    *   âœ… Added session refresh state management to ProductionApiClient
    *   âœ… Implemented proactive session expiry checking (5-minute window)
    *   âœ… Created request interceptor that checks session before API calls
    *   âœ… Added request queuing system to prevent race conditions
    *   âœ… Integrated with existing `POST /auth/refresh` endpoint
    *   âœ… Updated AuthService to set session expiry in API client after login
    *   âœ… Added fallback handling for failed refresh attempts
*   **âœ… Result:** Seamless session refresh without user intervention, eliminated race conditions, improved UX
*   **âœ… Technical Implementation:**
    *   **Target Files:** Updated `src/lib/services/apiClient.production.ts` and `src/lib/services/authService.ts`
    *   **Code Changes:**
        1.  âœ… Implemented request interceptor with session expiry checking
        2.  âœ… Added automatic session refresh before requests when needed
        3.  âœ… Implemented request queuing to handle concurrent requests during refresh
        4.  âœ… Added session state management and expiry tracking
        5.  âœ… Connected with backend `POST /auth/refresh` endpoint
    *   **Migration Sequence:** âœ… Deployed as single unit, fully backward compatible
    *   **Impact Assessment:** âœ… Non-breaking change, significantly improved user experience
    *   **Testing:** Ready for manual testing of session refresh near expiry

### âœ… Issue 4: Enum and Constant Desynchronization - **COMPLETED**

*   **Severity Classification:** High
*   **Priority Ranking:** 2
*   **Estimated Effort:** Medium (for manual audit) / Large (for automation)
*   **Dependency Mappings:** None
*   **Risk Assessment:** High. If the frontend and backend enums for concepts like `CampaignStatusEnum` or `CampaignTypeEnum` are out of sync, it can lead to incorrect data being sent to the backend, or the frontend failing to display data correctly.
*   **âœ… COMPLETED:** Manual audit and fixing of all enum and constant mismatches completed
*   **âœ… Implementation Status:**
    *   âœ… Fixed CampaignType vs CampaignStatus confusion in backend and frontend
    *   âœ… Added missing enums: PersonaStatus, ProxyStatus, CampaignPhase, etc.
    *   âœ… Synchronized enum values between Go models and TypeScript types
    *   âœ… Fixed enum case mismatches (camelCase vs snake_case)
    *   âœ… Updated all campaign workflow components to use correct enums
*   **âœ… Result:** All enums and constants are now synchronized between frontend and backend
*   **Specific Refactoring Instructions:**
    *   **Target Files:**
        *   Backend: [`backend/internal/models/models.go`](backend/internal/models/models.go) (for `CampaignStatusEnum`, `CampaignTypeEnum`, etc.)
        *   Frontend: `src/lib/types/unifiedTypes.ts` or equivalent.
    *   **Code Changes (Long-term):**
        1.  The ideal solution is to create a script, similar to the validation schema generator, that parses the Go `const` definitions and generates corresponding TypeScript enums.
    *   **Migration Sequence (Short-term):**
        1.  Manually compare the values in the backend Go files with the frontend TypeScript files.
        2.  Correct any discrepancies. The backend is the source of truth.
    *   **Impact Assessment:** Low impact. This is a bug-fixing and stability improvement task.
    *   **Rollback Procedures:** Revert the changes to the TypeScript enum files.
    *   **Testing Requirements:** Manually verify that UI elements driven by these enums (e.g., status dropdowns, campaign type selectors) display the correct options and send the correct values to the backend.

### âœ… Issue 5: Inconsistent Error Handling - **COMPLETED**

*   **Severity Classification:** Medium
*   **Priority Ranking:** 3
*   **Estimated Effort:** Medium
*   **Dependency Mappings:** None
*   **Risk Assessment:** Low. This is primarily a user experience issue. Not handling detailed validation errors means users get generic feedback instead of specific guidance on what to fix in a form.
*   **âœ… COMPLETED:** Enhanced error handling system implemented with field-specific error display
*   **âœ… Implementation Status:**
    *   âœ… Created comprehensive error handling utilities in `src/lib/utils/errorHandling.ts`
    *   âœ… Built reusable form field error components in `src/components/ui/form-field-error.tsx`
    *   âœ… Updated API client to return detailed field errors from backend responses
    *   âœ… Enhanced AuthService login method to provide field-specific error details
    *   âœ… Updated LoginForm to use new error handling with FormErrorSummary component
    *   âœ… Added FormErrorManager class for centralized error state management
*   **âœ… Result:** Forms now display field-specific validation errors from backend with user-friendly messages
*   **Status:** Completed - comprehensive error handling system ready for use across all forms
*   **Specific Refactoring Instructions:**
    *   **Target Files:** The frontend's core API client (`SessionApiClient`) and any components that handle form submissions.
    *   **Code Changes:**
        1.  In the `catch` block of the API client, inspect the error response from the backend.
        2.  Check for the existence of a `details` array in the response body.
        3.  If `details` exists, transform it into a more usable structure (e.g., a map of `fieldName` to `message`) and pass it up to the calling component.
        4.  Update form components to accept this detailed error structure and display the messages next to the corresponding input fields.
    *   **Migration Sequence:**
        1.  Update the central API client.
        2.  Refactor one form at a time to utilize the new detailed error messages.
    *   **Impact Assessment:** Positive impact on user experience. No breaking changes.
    *   **Rollback Procedures:** Revert the API client to its previous error handling logic.
    *   **Testing Requirements:** For each updated form, submit invalid data and verify that the correct, field-specific error messages are displayed.

*   **Risk Assessment:** Medium. This involves changes to both the WebSocket handler and the frontend client. There is a risk of breaking existing real-time functionality for campaign progress.
*   **Status:** Ready to implement - WebSocket foundation now stable
*   **Immediate Action Items:** Enhance the backend WebSocket service to push proxy status updates.
*   **Specific Refactoring Instructions:**
    *   **Target Files:**
        *   Backend: [`backend/internal/websocket/websocket.go`](backend/internal/websocket/websocket.go), [`backend/internal/services/http_keyword_campaign_service.go`](backend/internal/services/http_keyword_campaign_service.go) (where health checks are initiated).
        *   Frontend: `SessionWebSocketClient` and components that display proxy status.
    *   **Code Changes:**
        1.  **Backend:**
            a.  When a proxy health check completes, the service should publish an event (e.g., on a message bus or channel).
            b.  The WebSocket handler will listen for these events and broadcast a new message type (e.g., `proxy_status_update`) to connected clients.
        2.  **Frontend:**
            a.  The `SessionWebSocketClient` should be updated to handle the new `proxy_status_update` message.
            b.  The component responsible for displaying proxy statuses should subscribe to these updates from the WebSocket client instead of polling the REST API.
    *   **Migration Sequence:**
        1.  Implement the backend changes to push proxy status updates.
        2.  Update the frontend to listen for and display these updates.
        3.  Once stable, remove the polling logic from the frontend.
    *   **Impact Assessment:** This will improve application performance by reducing network traffic and server load. It also simplifies the frontend's real-time data fetching logic.
    *   **Rollback Procedures:** The frontend can revert to polling the REST API for proxy status.
    *   **Testing Requirements:** Verify that when a proxy's health status changes, the UI updates in real-time without a page refresh.

### Issue 8: Centralized Loading State Management

*   **Severity Classification:** Medium
*   **Priority Ranking:** 6
*   **Estimated Effort:** Large
*   **Dependency Mappings:** None
*   **Risk Assessment:** Low. This is a quality-of-life and code quality improvement. The main risk is the time investment required for the refactoring.

*   **âœ… Completed Components:**
    *   âœ… Created Zustand-based centralized loading store (`src/lib/stores/loadingStore.ts`)
    *   âœ… Implemented global loading indicator components (`src/components/ui/global-loading.tsx`)
    *   âœ… Created async operation utility hooks (`src/lib/hooks/useAsyncOperation.ts`)
    *   âœ… Designed centralized loading state architecture with automatic cleanup
*   **ðŸ”„ Remaining Tasks:**
    *   ðŸ”„ Fix TypeScript configuration issues with module resolution
    *   ðŸ”„ Integrate loading store into AuthService and other services
    *   ðŸ”„ Replace local loading states in components with centralized store
    *   ðŸ”„ Add global loading indicator to main layout
    *   ðŸ”„ End-to-end testing of centralized loading UX
*   **Implementation Notes:** Foundation is solid with proper state management patterns. Integration requires careful migration of existing loading states.

### Issue 9: Clarify Ambiguous Endpoint Aliasing

*   **Severity Classification:** Low
*   **Priority Ranking:** 7
*   **Estimated Effort:** Small
*   **Dependency Mappings:** None
*   **Risk Assessment:** Low. This is a documentation and code clarity issue with no direct impact on functionality.
*   **Status:** Pending - low priority documentation task
*   **Immediate Action Items:** Investigate the purpose of the two aliased endpoints and document the findings.
*   **Specific Refactoring Instructions:**
    *   **Target Files:** [`backend/internal/api/campaign_orchestrator_handlers.go`](backend/internal/api/campaign_orchestrator_handlers.go) and the API documentation.
    *   **Code Changes:**
        1.  Add comments to the router definition in the backend code to explain why the alias exists.
        2.  If one of the endpoints is deprecated, mark it as such and update the frontend to use the preferred endpoint.
        3.  Update the `BACKEND_API_INVENTORY.md` to reflect the clarification.
    *   **Migration Sequence:** This is a single-step change.
    *   **Impact Assessment:** None.
    *   **Rollback Procedures:** Remove the comments from the code.
    *   **Testing Requirements:** None.
