## Critical Risks (Score 20-25)

### R001: Integer Overflow Data Corruption
**Score: 25** (Impact: 5, Likelihood: 5)

**Description**: JavaScript's number type limitation causes data corruption when handling Go int64 values > 2^53, leading to incorrect campaign statistics and processing counts.

**Current State**: Frontend using unsafe `number` type for all numeric fields from backend.

**Potential Impact**:
- Campaign processing totals displayed incorrectly
- Business decisions based on wrong data
- Billing discrepancies for usage-based pricing
- Loss of data integrity and audit trail

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Immediate**: Deploy SafeBigInt implementation (Phase 1.1)
2. **Short-term**: Add database constraints to detect overflow
3. **Long-term**: Implement comprehensive BigInt handling across stack

**Rollback Complexity**: Low - TypeScript changes can be reverted quickly

**Monitoring**:
- Alert on values approaching 2^53
- Track BigInt conversion errors
- Monitor data consistency between layers

---

### R002: Production WebSocket Breakage
**Score: 20** (Impact: 5, Likelihood: 4)

**Description**: WebSocket message format mismatch prevents real-time updates from reaching frontend, breaking live campaign monitoring.

**Current State**: Frontend expects fields that backend doesn't send.

**Potential Impact**:
- No real-time campaign progress updates
- Users unaware of campaign failures
- Increased support tickets
- Degraded user experience

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Immediate**: Deploy fixed WebSocket types (Phase 1.2)
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive WebSocket testing in staging
3. **Rollout**: Gradual deployment with feature flags

**Rollback Complexity**: Medium - Requires coordinated frontend/backend rollback

**Monitoring**:
- WebSocket connection failures
- Message parsing errors
- User reports of missing updates

---

## High Risks (Score 15-19)

### R003: Database Migration Failures
**Score: 16** (Impact: 4, Likelihood: 4)

**Description**: SQL migrations could fail or cause performance issues in production database.

**Potential Impact**:
- Service downtime during migration
- Locked tables affecting performance
- Potential data loss if rollback needed
- Cascading failures in dependent services

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Pre-deployment**: Test migrations on production-like data
2. **Execution**: Run during maintenance window
3. **Backup**: Full database backup before migration
4. **Staged approach**: Apply constraints incrementally

**Rollback Complexity**: High - Database rollbacks require careful planning

**Monitoring**:
- Migration execution time
- Lock wait timeouts
- Query performance degradation

---

### R004: API Contract Breaking Changes
**Score: 15** (Impact: 5, Likelihood: 3)

**Description**: Field naming corrections and type changes could break existing API consumers.

**Potential Impact**:
- Third-party integrations fail
- Mobile apps stop working
- Partner API connections break
- Revenue loss from API downtime

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Versioning**: Implement API versioning before changes
2. **Deprecation**: Maintain backward compatibility temporarily
3. **Communication**: Notify all API consumers in advance
4. **Grace period**: 30-day migration window

**Rollback Complexity**: Medium - Requires API version management

**Monitoring**:
- API error rates by consumer
- Deprecated endpoint usage
- Consumer migration progress

---

### R005: Team Productivity Impact
**Score: 15** (Impact: 3, Likelihood: 5)

**Description**: New validation requirements and type safety measures slow down development.

**Potential Impact**:
- Increased development time
- Frustration with new constraints
- Delayed feature delivery
- Resistance to adoption

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Training**: Comprehensive team training sessions
2. **Tooling**: Automated type generation and validation
3. **Documentation**: Clear guidelines and examples
4. **Support**: Dedicated channel for questions

**Rollback Complexity**: Low - Process changes can be adjusted

**Monitoring**:
- PR approval times

## Medium Risks (Score 10-14)

### R006: Performance Degradation
**Score: 12** (Impact: 4, Likelihood: 3)

**Description**: BigInt operations and additional validation layers could impact system performance.

**Potential Impact**:
- Slower API response times
- Increased server resource usage
- Database query slowdowns
- User experience degradation

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Benchmarking**: Performance test before deployment
2. **Optimization**: Profile and optimize hot paths
3. **Caching**: Implement caching for expensive operations
4. **Scaling**: Prepare to scale infrastructure if needed

**Rollback Complexity**: Low - Code changes can be reverted

**Monitoring**:
- API response time percentiles
- CPU and memory usage
- Database query performance

---

### R007: Incomplete Test Coverage
**Score: 12** (Impact: 3, Likelihood: 4)

**Description**: Existing tests may not cover all contract alignment scenarios.

**Potential Impact**:
- Bugs slip into production
- Edge cases cause failures
- Reduced confidence in changes
- Increased incident rate

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Test audit**: Review and expand test coverage
2. **Contract tests**: Add specific contract validation tests
3. **Integration tests**: Test cross-layer interactions
4. **Monitoring**: Track test coverage metrics

**Rollback Complexity**: N/A - Testing improvements only

**Monitoring**:
- Code coverage percentage
- Test failure rates
- Production incident correlation
