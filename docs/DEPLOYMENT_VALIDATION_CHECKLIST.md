  - [ ] Check: No critical issues in validation results
  - [ ] Validate: All implemented fixes are verified

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Backup Current System
- [ ] Database backup with timestamp
- [ ] Configuration file backup
- [ ] Current application version tagged in Git

### 2. Deploy Backend Changes
- [ ] Deploy backend service with enhanced logging
- [ ] Verify service starts successfully
- [ ] Check logs for any startup errors
- [ ] Validate API health endpoint responds

### 3. Deploy Frontend Changes
- [ ] Deploy frontend with authentication fixes
- [ ] Clear browser caches/CDN if applicable
- [ ] Verify static assets are properly served

### 4. Database Updates
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Run permission verification script
  ```sql
  -- Execute in production database
  \i verify_and_fix_permissions.sql
  ```
- [ ] Review script output for any issues
- [ ] Verify admin users have proper permissions

### 5. Post-Deployment Smoke Tests
- [ ] **Authentication Flow Test**
  - [ ] Login as super admin user
  - [ ] Verify dashboard loads without errors
  - [ ] Access campaigns page successfully
  - [ ] Check permission checks work correctly

- [ ] **API Functionality Test**
  - [ ] Test `/api/v2/me` endpoint
  - [ ] Test `/api/v2/campaigns` endpoint
  - [ ] Verify CSRF token handling
  - [ ] Check session refresh functionality

---

## üîç Post-Deployment Validation

### ‚úÖ Functional Testing
- [ ] **Super Admin Campaign Access**
  - [ ] Login as super admin user
  - [ ] Navigate to `/campaigns` page
  - [ ] Verify no "insufficient permissions" error
  - [ ] Confirm campaign list loads properly
  - [ ] Test campaign creation if applicable

- [ ] **Permission System Integrity**
  - [ ] Run: `runFullAuthValidation()` in production browser console
  - [ ] Verify: Overall status is "HEALTHY"
  - [ ] Check: No critical issues detected
  - [ ] Validate: Production readiness is `true`

- [ ] **Cross-User Testing**
  - [ ] Test regular user permissions (should be restricted)
  - [ ] Test admin user permissions (should have admin access)
  - [ ] Verify role-based access control works correctly

### ‚úÖ Monitoring Setup
- [ ] **Log Monitoring**
  - [ ] Set up alerts for authentication failures > 5%
  - [ ] Monitor permission validation errors > 1%
  - [ ] Track session refresh failure rate > 10%
  - [ ] Watch WebSocket connection failures > 15%

- [ ] **Application Monitoring**
  - [ ] Verify enhanced authentication logging is working
  - [ ] Check performance metrics for any degradation
  - [ ] Monitor error rates for authentication endpoints

### ‚úÖ Security Validation
- [ ] **CSRF Protection**
  - [ ] Verify CSRF tokens are properly generated and validated
  - [ ] Test API calls require proper CSRF headers
  - [ ] Check token rotation works correctly

- [ ] **Session Security**
  - [ ] Verify session expiration works
  - [ ] Test session invalidation on logout
  - [ ] Check concurrent session handling

---

## üö® Rollback Criteria

### Immediate Rollback Required If:
- [ ] Super admin cannot access campaigns page after 5 minutes
- [ ] Authentication failure rate > 20%
- [ ] Any user cannot login who could before deployment
- [ ] Critical application functionality is broken
- [ ] Database integrity issues detected

### Rollback Process:
1. Restore previous application version
2. Restore database from backup if database changes were made
3. Clear caches and restart services
4. Verify system functionality returns to pre-deployment state
5. Document issues for post-mortem analysis

## üìä Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ Deployment Considered Successful When:
- [ ] Super admin users can access `/campaigns` page without errors
- [ ] All authentication flows work correctly (login, logout, session refresh)
- [ ] Permission checks return correct results for all user roles
- [ ] No increase in authentication-related error rates
- [ ] WebSocket connections work properly in all environments
- [ ] Comprehensive validation suite reports "HEALTHY" status
- [ ] All diagnostic tools report successful validation

### üìà Key Performance Indicators:
- Authentication success rate: > 95%
- Permission validation accuracy: > 99%
- Session refresh success rate: > 90%
- Campaign page access success rate for admin users: 100%

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### "Permission format issues detected"
- **Cause**: Frontend not properly converting Permission objects to strings
- **Solution**: Run `runAuthFixTests()` and check `permission_data_format` test
- **Fix**: Verify `mapUserToAuthUser()` function is working correctly

#### "Auth state synchronization issues"
- **Cause**: AuthContext clearing valid auth state
- **Solution**: Run `testAuthContextFlow()` to diagnose
- **Fix**: Check AuthContext session verification logic

#### "Database permission assignments missing"
- **Cause**: Super admin role missing campaign permissions
- **Solution**: Re-run `verify_and_fix_permissions.sql`
- **Fix**: Verify role-permission assignments in database

#### "WebSocket connection failures"
- **Cause**: Origin validation rejecting valid connections
- **Solution**: Check WebSocket server logs for origin validation
- **Fix**: Verify development/production origin configuration
