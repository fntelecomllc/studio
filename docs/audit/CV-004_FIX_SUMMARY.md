# CV-004 Fix Summary: Missing Required Field - currentOffset

## Issue
The `currentOffset` field exists in Go backend's DomainGenerationCampaignParams but was missing from the TypeScript API client type definition, causing type mismatches.

## Root Cause
The auto-generated TypeScript interface `ServicesDomainGenerationParams` was missing the `currentOffset` field that exists in the Go backend and database schema.

## Resolution

### Changes Made

1. **Added currentOffset to Base API Type** (`src/lib/api-client/models/services-domain-generation-params.ts`):
   ```typescript
   /**
    * @type {number}
    * @memberof ServicesDomainGenerationParams
    */
   'currentOffset'?: number;
   ```

2. **Existing Aligned Type Already Had Support** (`src/lib/api-client/models/services-domain-generation-params-aligned.ts`):
   - The aligned version already included `currentOffset?: SafeBigInt`
   - Transformation functions already handled the field correctly

3. **Other Types Already Had currentOffset**:
   - `src/lib/types.ts`: DomainGenerationCampaignParams includes `currentOffset: SafeBigInt`
   - `src/lib/types/aligned/aligned-models.ts`: DomainGenerationParams includes `currentOffset: SafeBigInt`
   - `src/lib/schemas/generated/validationSchemas.ts`: domainGenerationCampaignParamsSchema includes `currentOffset: z.number().int().gte(0)`
   - `src/lib/types/aligned/transformation-layer.ts`: INT64_FIELDS.domainGeneration includes 'currentOffset'

### Verification

Created verification test (`src/lib/api-client/__tests__/verify-currentoffset-field.ts`) that confirms:
- ✅ currentOffset field exists in ServicesDomainGenerationParams
- ✅ currentOffset field exists in ServicesDomainGenerationParamsAligned
- ✅ Both fields are properly typed as optional
- ✅ Aligned types use SafeBigInt for int64 field safety

### Test Results
```
✅ CV-004 Fix Verified: currentOffset field exists in all relevant types
✅ Both currentOffset and totalPossibleCombinations are properly typed as optional fields
✅ Aligned types use SafeBigInt for int64 field safety
```

## Impact
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript now correctly reflects the Go backend contract
- **Data Integrity**: currentOffset can be properly sent to and received from the API
- **Compatibility**: No breaking changes - field is optional as in Go (*int64)

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Runtime verification test confirms field presence
- Both currentOffset and totalPossibleCombinations work together as expected

## Conclusion
CV-004 has been fully resolved. The `currentOffset` field is now present in all TypeScript types that correspond to DomainGenerationCampaignParams, maintaining consistency with the Go backend and database schema.
