# H-002 Fix Summary: Missing sourceType Field in HTTP Keyword Parameters

**Issue ID:** H-002  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Component:** Generated API Client Types  
**Fixed By:** Code Mode  
**Date:** 2025-06-20  

## Issue Description

The generated API client type `ServicesHttpKeywordParams` was missing the required `sourceType` field. This field is mandatory in the backend for HTTP keyword validation campaigns and specifies whether the source domains come from 'DomainGeneration' or 'DNSValidation' campaigns.

### Contract Violation Details

From CONTRACT_VIOLATIONS_MATRIX.md (Line 150):
- **Endpoint:** POST /api/v2/campaigns
- **Field:** httpKeywordParams.sourceType
- **Backend:** Required: 'DomainGeneration' or 'DNSValidation'
- **Frontend:** Generated types missing this field
- **Issue:** Missing required field
- **Severity:** HIGH

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. `src/lib/api-client/models/services-http-keyword-params.ts`
   - Added `sourceType` as a required field
   - Added `ServicesHttpKeywordParamsSourceTypeEnum` with PascalCase values matching backend

### Key Changes:

1. **Added sourceType field:**
   ```typescript
   /**
    * 
    * @type {string}
    * @memberof ServicesHttpKeywordParams
    */
   'sourceType': ServicesHttpKeywordParamsSourceTypeEnum;
   ```

2. **Added sourceType enum:**
   ```typescript
   export const ServicesHttpKeywordParamsSourceTypeEnum = {
       DomainGeneration: 'DomainGeneration',
       DnsValidation: 'DNSValidation'
   } as const;
   
   export type ServicesHttpKeywordParamsSourceTypeEnum = typeof ServicesHttpKeywordParamsSourceTypeEnum[keyof typeof ServicesHttpKeywordParamsSourceTypeEnum];
   ```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `src/lib/api-client/models/__tests__/http-keyword-params-source-type.test.ts`:
- Verifies sourceType is included as a required field
- Tests enum values match backend expectations (PascalCase)
- Ensures TypeScript enforcement at compile time
- Validates only allowed enum values are accepted

**Test Results:** All tests passing (4/4 tests)

## Verification

The fix ensures:
1. HTTP keyword validation campaigns can properly specify their source type
2. TypeScript provides compile-time safety for the sourceType field
3. The values match the backend's PascalCase expectations ('DomainGeneration', 'DNSValidation')
4. The field is required, preventing campaigns from being created without this critical information

## Impact

- **Before:** HTTP keyword campaigns could not be created through the TypeScript client due to missing required field
- **After:** Full contract alignment with backend, enabling proper HTTP keyword campaign creation
- **User Impact:** Users can now create HTTP keyword validation campaigns that properly specify their domain source

## Architecture Compliance

This fix maintains the closed-loop campaign orchestration architecture:
- Does NOT introduce alternative flows or input methods
- Maintains the sequential pipeline (Domain Generation → DNS Validation → HTTP Keyword Validation)
- The sourceType field only accepts values from the pipeline ('DomainGeneration', 'DNSValidation')
- No architectural changes were made

## Related Issues

This fix addresses one of the HIGH priority contract violations. Other HIGH priority issues identified as false positives:
- Campaign 'archived' status - Actually exists in backend
- Generic persona endpoints - Backend does have unified endpoints
- Session refresh - Frontend already implements this
- totalPossibleCombinations/currentOffset - Already present in generated types

## Next Steps

Continue reviewing CONTRACT_VIOLATIONS_MATRIX.md for other genuine HIGH priority issues that need addressing.
