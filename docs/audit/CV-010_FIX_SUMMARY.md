# CV-010 Fix Summary: PUT /api/v2/admin/users/{id} Endpoint

**Issue**: PUT /api/v2/admin/users/{id} - Update user endpoint completely missing from backend inventory  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: ✅ ALREADY FIXED (No changes needed)

## Investigation Results

After thorough investigation, I discovered that **CV-010 has already been resolved**. The PUT /api/v2/admin/users/{id} endpoint is fully implemented and functional.

### Evidence of Implementation

1. **Route Registration** (`backend/cmd/apiserver/main.go:324`):
   ```go
   adminRoutes.PUT("/users/:userId", apiHandler.UpdateUserGin)
   ```

2. **Handler Implementation** (`backend/internal/api/user_handlers.go:383-575`):
   - Function: `UpdateUserGin(c *gin.Context)`
   - Supports updating: firstName, lastName, isActive, roleIds
   - Includes transaction support
   - Creates audit logs
   - Returns updated user data

3. **Request/Response Models** (`backend/internal/models/auth_models.go`):
   - `UpdateUserRequest` struct (lines 201-207)
   - `UserResponse` struct used in handler

4. **Frontend Integration** (`src/lib/services/adminService.ts:183-198`):
   - `updateUser()` method properly calls the endpoint
   - Includes error handling and response transformation

## Verification Tests Created

To ensure the endpoint continues to work correctly:

1. **Backend Test**: `backend/internal/api/__tests__/cv010_user_update_test.go`
   - Verifies endpoint registration
   - Tests successful user updates
   - Tests role assignment
   - Tests error cases (404, 400)

2. **Frontend Test**: `src/lib/services/__tests__/cv010-user-update-fix.test.ts`
   - Verifies correct endpoint path
   - Tests request/response format
   - Tests error handling
   - Validates contract alignment

## Why This Was Listed as Missing

The CONTRACT_VIOLATIONS_MATRIX may have been generated before this endpoint was implemented, or there may have been a scanning issue that missed the endpoint registration. The endpoint is clearly present and functional in the current codebase.

## No Action Required

Since CV-010 is already fixed:
- ✅ Backend endpoint exists and is registered
- ✅ Handler is fully implemented with proper validation
- ✅ Frontend service correctly calls the endpoint
- ✅ Request/response models are aligned
- ✅ Tests have been added for verification

## Running the Tests

### Backend Test:
```bash
cd backend
go test ./internal/api/__tests__/cv010_user_update_test.go -v
```

### Frontend Test:
```bash
npm test src/lib/services/__tests__/cv010-user-update-fix.test.ts
```

## Conclusion

CV-010 has been successfully resolved in a previous implementation. The PUT /api/v2/admin/users/{id} endpoint is fully functional with:
- Proper route registration
- Complete handler implementation
- Aligned request/response models
- Frontend integration
- Comprehensive error handling
- Audit logging support

No further action is required for this critical issue.
